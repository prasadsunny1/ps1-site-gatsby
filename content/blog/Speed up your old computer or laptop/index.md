Trust me when I say that your computer is not as slow as it feels for you now. For most of us no matter how latest laptop models we try to buy, If it has HDD, it will start to get slower as we put our data and install more programs on it.

> HDDs are the slowest part of any computer and that's why it is called secondary memory

## Solution

The solution is to replace HDD in your computer with SSD.
SSDs (Solid State Drive) are different and newer kind of storage option. Unlike HDD they do not have any moving parts, no disk no spinning no vibration nothing. Also they are generally 10 to 50 times faster at handling your files. Compared to HDD which can handle 10 to 15 read/write operations per second, SSD can easily handle more than 2000 read write operations.

Those merits converts into a great experience for you as a user. Your computer which used to take around 3 to 5 minutes to turn on and get ready for you to work on, with SSD you can start working on your computer in less than 30 seconds after pressing the power button.
Also your programs like Microsoft word or photoshop should load 3 to 10 times faster.
Or as a programmer my code compilation times are at least 3 times faster.

> As a professional saved second is money.

Or every saved second for my mom when turning on her computer means little less of listening to how slow is this computer son.
